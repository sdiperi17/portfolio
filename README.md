After several years in the financial services industry, my natural curiosity and desire to understand complex processes led me to explore software engineering and web development. I am fascinated by the ability to program computers to perform multiple tasks and execute functions that simplify lives.

I'm an ambitious, resourceful, and collaborative Full Stack Developer with a strong background in creating user-friendly applications that are highly available, scalable, secure, and resilient. I take a solutions-driven approach to development, believing that every challenge can be overcome by breaking it down into smaller, manageable components. I am constantly seeking dynamic and efficient ways to tackle challenging problems.

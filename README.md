After several years working as insurance underwriter, my natural curiosity and desire to understand how each process at every level works led me to explore the world of software engineering and web develeopment. The ability to program computers to handle multiple tasks and execute functions to simplify the lives of others is of great interest to me.

I'm an ambitious, recourceful and collaborative Full Stack Developer leveraging my four years of experience in insurance industry to develop applications that easy to use, highly available, redundant, scalable, secure and that simplifies the lives of others. As an developer, I take solutions-driven approach believing that every problem can be solved by breaking down issues into smaller, manageable components. I am always seeking out dynamic and efficient ways to solve challenging problems.
